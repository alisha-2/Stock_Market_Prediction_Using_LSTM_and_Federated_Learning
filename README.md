# Stock_Market_Prediction_Using_LSTM_and_Federated_Learning


This study on stock market prediction using Federated Learning (FL) highlights its significant advantages over traditional centralized models. Federated Learning demonstrates remarkable potential in enhancing prediction accuracy, as evidenced by its superior performance compared to models applied to major international exchanges like the Bombay Stock Exchange, New York Stock Exchange, London Stock Exchange, and Tokyo Stock Exchange. FLâ€™s decentralized approach addresses critical issues of data privacy, security, and regulatory compliance by enabling on-site local model training and sharing only model updates with a central aggregator, thereby safeguarding data confidentiality and adhering to stringent financial regulations.

The analysis reveals that financial markets' inherent complexity and volatility necessitate advanced machine learning techniques to model intricate patterns effectively. While Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks excel in handling time series data with long-term dependencies, their integration with Federated Learning enhances prediction robustness and accuracy. The federated model consistently outperforms traditional LSTM models across all stock exchanges in terms of accuracy, proving more reliable for financial forecasting.

Additionally, the Federated Learning framework, which involves multiple local clients and a central aggregation server, shows efficiency and scalability in processing real-time data and making decisions. These findings underscore the promise of combining LSTM networks with Federated Learning to develop advanced predictive models that ensure both high accuracy and data security. This approach represents a significant advancement in financial analysis and trading strategies, offering a path toward improved stock prediction accuracy while maintaining stringent data privacy standards.
